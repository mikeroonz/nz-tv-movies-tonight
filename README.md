# nz-tv-movies-tonight
Python webscrape the list of Movies on NZ TV tonight

This was an example for some students so the code is as concise as possible.  I removed the full URL for the NZCity TVNow Guide webpage in case bots grab and run python code.
Should the page format change, this may stop working.

getmovies.py
  - the string choppy version for programmers that haven't got to objects/classes yet.
  
getmovies-advanced.py
  - uses the HTMLParser library - requires a bit of objecty knowledge.

Sure there's great webscraping and regular expression libraries which would make for a more complete and flexible program, but this is intentionally a little 'closer to the metal' for educational purposes.
